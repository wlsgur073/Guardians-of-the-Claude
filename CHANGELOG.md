# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.7.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- `/generate` starter command defaults: add C/CMake and C++/CMake rows (were absent from table)
- `/generate` starter: Python install command `pip install -e .` → `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `/generate` starter: Go lint default `golangci-lint run` → `go vet ./...` (external tool not guaranteed)
- `/generate` starter: Java assumes `mvn` by default, with note to detect wrapper before suggesting `./mvnw`
- `/generate` advanced: remove Node.js-specific passport.js reference from security rule template
- `/audit` T2.2: add SKIP condition for projects with no security-relevant surface (CLI tools, libraries)
- `/audit` T2.1/T2.3: define explicit behavior for malformed/unparseable settings.json

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-03

### Changed

- `/audit` scoring model redesigned: additive tier-weighted → Foundation-Gated Multiplicative (`Final = min(FG × DS + SB + LQM, 100)`)
- Per-item weights within tiers replace equal weighting — test command (0.35) outweighs build command (0.20) in T1
- Penalty Cap removed — Foundation Gate naturally suppresses scores when foundations are missing
- Quality Gate changed from score-affecting to display-only label
- SKIP paths added to 1.2 test command, 1.3 build command (docs/template repos), 3.1 directory refs, 3.3 command availability
- PARTIAL added to 1.3 build command and 3.3 command availability for complete branching

### Added

- Synergy Bonus (+5 max): rewards complementary item pairs (test+build, sensitive file protection+security rules)
- LLM Quality Modifier (+8 max): constrained content quality judgment (overview accuracy, command executability, non-obvious patterns)
- Audit history includes model version (v2) for cross-version score comparison

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- MCP integration guide with Korean translation — configuration, server types, deferred tool loading, security
- Template files: 2 agents (security-reviewer, test-writer), 1 skill (run-checks), hook script (validate-prompt.sh), .mcp.json
- Guide sections: script-based hooks, agent design patterns, skill design patterns, organizing at scale, brownfield adoption
- MCP option in `/generate` and MCP suggestion in `/audit`
- Tiered scoring model for `/audit` — Foundation (50%), Protection (30%), Optimization (20%) with 4-level scale, Quality Gate, Penalty Cap, and Maturity Levels
- Memory integration in `/audit` (saves results) and `/generate` (remembers declined features)
- Philosophy section in README (EN/KO)
- Dispatch tables (skills/agents) in advanced template CLAUDE.md

### Changed

- `/generate` agent template: 2-section → 4-section (Scope/Rules/Constraints/Verification)
- CHANGELOG restored to Keep a Changelog format with concise entries
- ROADMAP simplified: removed Completed table, kept Vision + Backlog
- Guide versions bumped to v1.1.0 (advanced-features, claude-md, getting-started, effective-usage)
- `advanced-features-guide.md` line limit relaxed to ~200

### Fixed

- Dead GitHub Discussions links across 4 files
- Broken relative path in getting-started.md (`../README.md` → `../../README.md`)
- English anchor links in Korean guides restored to Korean anchors
- Korean agent `name` fields restored to English (identifiers)

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- Security rules, agent quality, and hook quality checks in `/audit`
- Incremental mode in `/generate` — detects existing config, adds only what's missing
- Self-verification phase (3.5) in `/generate` — validates output before wrapping up
- Model routing guidance (haiku/sonnet/opus) with cost tradeoff notes in advanced features guide
- Security rule file option in `/generate` advanced features

### Changed

- Agent examples: 2-section → 4-section (Scope/Rules/Constraints/Verification)
- Hook examples: added PreToolUse file protection with `exit 2` alongside PostToolUse auto-linting
- YAML model comments (`# sonnet: ...`) for self-documenting agent definitions
- Replaced YAML frontmatter `date` field with independent per-file `version` (semver)
- `/audit` scoring rebalanced to 70/30 (Essential/Alignment)

### Fixed

- Hook exit code `exit 1` → `exit 2` for proper Claude feedback on blocked actions
- Missing YAML frontmatter in 4 Korean rule files

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- `/audit` skill for validating Claude Code configuration health with weighted scoring
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` with community-driven proposal process
- `docs/plans/` directory for design and planning documents

### Changed

- Restructured directories: `guide/` → `docs/guides/`, `ko-KR/` → `docs/i18n/ko-KR/`
- Documentation quality audit across 14 files — improved clarity, conciseness, and consistency

### Fixed

- Updated stale path references in CONTRIBUTING.md

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-30
