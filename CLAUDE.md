# CLAUDE.md
<!-- Last reviewed: 2026-04-06 -->

This is a documentation and template repository — it contains no application code, no build system, and no tests. Its purpose is to teach developers how to configure Claude Code for their own projects.

## Repository Structure

- `.claude-plugin/` — Marketplace manifest (makes this repo a plugin marketplace)
- `plugin/` — Plugin package containing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/create/SKILL.md` (`/claude-code-template:create`), `skills/audit/SKILL.md` (`/claude-code-template:audit`), `skills/secure/SKILL.md` (`/claude-code-template:secure`), `skills/optimize/SKILL.md` (`/claude-code-template:optimize`), `skills/generate/SKILL.md` (deprecated redirect to `/create`), `references/security-patterns.md` (shared), and `hooks/hooks.json`
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Version history in Keep a Changelog format
- `templates/starter/` — Minimal filled example for TaskFlow (5-section CLAUDE.md + basic settings.json)
- `templates/advanced/` — Full filled example for TaskFlow (rules, hooks, agents, skills, MCP)
- `docs/guides/` — Guides covering each Claude Code configuration concept (CLAUDE.md writing, rules, settings, directory structure, effective usage patterns, advanced features, MCP integration)
- `docs/i18n/ko-KR/` — Korean translations (`guides/`, `templates/`, `README.md`)
- `docs/plans/` — Design and planning documents for feature work
- `docs/*.md` — GitHub community health files and project governance (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, PRIVACY.md, ROADMAP.md)
- `.claude/` — This repo's own Claude Code settings

## Contribution Rules

- Templates must all reference the fictional "TaskFlow" project — do not introduce other fictional projects
- Templates (under `templates/`) and guides (under `docs/guides/`) use YAML frontmatter with `title`, `description`, and `version` fields — each file has its own independent semver starting from `1.0.0`; bump the version when modifying the file's content
- Guides in `docs/guides/` should stay concise — most under ~130 lines, `advanced-features-guide.md` under ~200 (covers 3 topics with code examples)
- This CLAUDE.md should stay under 200 lines, matching the repo's own recommendation in `docs/guides/claude-md-guide.md`
- There is no source code — all content is Markdown. Review for clarity, accuracy, and consistency across files
- When adding a new guide, follow the existing frontmatter format (`title`, `description`, `version`) and add cross-links from `docs/guides/getting-started.md`
- When modifying guides or templates, verify `/create`, `/audit`, `/secure`, and `/optimize` skills still align — check that skill templates, checklists, and suggestions reflect the updated patterns
- CLAUDE.md files under `templates/` are repo content, not instructions for this repo — Claude will lazy-load them when working in those directories, so keep them clearly framed as examples

## Plugin Development Rules

- Skills go in `plugin/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — do NOT use `commands/` (legacy)
- Each skill must have YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- `allowed-tools` is no longer supported in skill frontmatter; agents use `tools` for tool restriction
- Plugin version is managed in `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` only — do NOT duplicate version in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- Marketplace name (`wlsgur073-plugins`) must NOT match the GitHub repo name case pattern to avoid Windows NTFS rename failures
